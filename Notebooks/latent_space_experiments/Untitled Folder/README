## Latent-Space Impersonation (Iteration 2 - CPU-Constrained)

This experiment represents the second iteration of latent-space adversarial
impersonation against embedding-based face authentication systems.

Earlier attempts explored optimisation-based inversion of real face images into
StyleGAN latent space. While effective in principle, inversion proved prohibitively
computationally expensive on CPU-only hardware and limited experimental iteration.

This iteration therefore adopts a more realistic and resource-aware threat model:
latent optimisation without inversion. Rather than reconstructing a real source
face, the attack begins from a randomly sampled latent vector and optimises it
directly to impersonate a target identity in embedding space.

This design choice reflects a plausible attacker scenario where photorealistic
synthetic faces are generated and optimised to pass embedding-based verification,
without requiring access to the original victim’s biometric data.

All decisions prioritise reproducibility, transparency, and alignment with
real-world deployment constraints.
